# STR
This is the implementation for the paper "A Selective Training Paradigm for Recommender Systems with Sample Utility".

The dataset is available [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/118Lv7o9Lqll-d5-tR3Di3CT1yS2uyGle?usp=drive_link). Move the files to the STR folder.

Try to run one example of the framework with the base model `SASRec` and dataset `Amazon_Beauty`:
```
python run_RM.py --model SASRec --dataset Amazon_Beauty
```
